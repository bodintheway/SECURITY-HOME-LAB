# SECURITY-HOME-LAB
Building my own cybersecurity home LAN environment.


To begin my cybersecurity home lab project, I first ensured that virtualization was enabled in my system's BIOS. I then installed Oracle VirtualBox, a free and open-source hypervisor, to host and manage my virtual machines. Following Ben Heater's comprehensive guide on building a security lab in VirtualBox, I planned the network architecture and set up the initial virtual machines, starting with pfSense as the firewall and router for the lab environment


Installing the VirtualBox Extension Pack
After installing Oracle VirtualBox, it's highly recommended to install the VirtualBox Extension Pack to enhance functionality and improve support for USB 2.0/3.0 devices, VirtualBox RDP, PXE boot for Intel cards, and other features.

To install it:

Download the latest version of the Extension Pack from the official VirtualBox website.
